### bankhack
Simple bash script to simulate a wire transfer over SWIFT.

## Story
So one day I stumbled across https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood and thought it was so funny and perfect, all it needed was a companion to pull up in a separate window to "hack the bank" and make it rain.

Sat down with an IDE and a terminal and went to work.

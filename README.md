# Bankhack
Simple bash script to simulate a wire transfer over SWIFT.
This script really does nothing useful but display something you can use to mess with your friends, family, co-workers, or even as a working prop in a movie or TV show.

## Story
So one day a few months back, I stumbled across https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood and thought it was so funny and perfect, all it needed was a companion to pull up in a separate window to "hack the bank" and make it rain.

I thought about how I would want it to look and work for a couple days and read through some example snippets of code I could find here and there. 

Then one day on while having lunch, I popped open an IDE and a terminal and went to work. I basically taught myself how to do this; wrote a working version; refactored to clean up the code and make it display better, and commented it like I see the pros do. This is my first written from scratch block of code, ever. And I did it all in just under an hour and a half. 

Fuck making a dumb "Hello World"... this was more fun.

## Installation

It's just a simple bash script. Clone it and then run straight from the prompt.
The only requirements are:
  - curl
  - dialog
